# nscr-houdini-mcp

An MCP server and a small set of agent skills for SideFX Houdini 22.

Status: early. Nothing here is usable yet.

## Goals

- A small tool set with direct Python access to Houdini, so the context cost stays low.
- Works with any MCP client. No client-specific rules.
- One setup talks to many Houdini sessions at once, both open GUI sessions and headless workers.
- Agents check their work against a reference image before they call it done.
- Renders, caches and captures go to managed folders next to the scene file.
- Plain `SKILL.md` skills that help an agent build scenes a person can read, change and reuse. You can edit them to fit how you work.

## Development

Python 3.11 or newer. The server process never imports `hou`.

Setup, with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```sh
uv venv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Or with the standard library:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Checks, the same ones CI runs:

```sh
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
pytest -q
python scripts/lint_client_names.py   # shipped text must not name any client or vendor
python scripts/tools_list_cost.py     # estimated token cost of the tools/list payload
```

`scripts/tools_list_cost.py` serialises the tool list the way a client receives
it and estimates tokens as bytes divided by four, rounded up. That is a budget
signal to watch across commits, not an exact count. Pass `--max-tokens N` to
make it fail over a budget.

Git hooks:

```sh
scripts/install-hooks
```

This sets `core.hooksPath` to the tracked `hooks/` directory. The hooks check
staged content and the commit message against a private term list at
`.context/leak-terms.txt`, which is ignored by git and kept only on your own
machine. They fail closed: with no list, every commit is refused.

Run the server on stdio:

```sh
nscr-houdini-mcp
```
